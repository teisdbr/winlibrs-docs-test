# LIBRS Specifications Documentation

This document contains information about the Segments, Data Elements, Requirements, Errors, and Warnings that LIBRS uses in the validation of Incident Data.

## Required Segments

The LIBRS Flat File is a space-delimited file generated by following the requirements in this document. Each section of this document outlines individual Segments. Each Segment is an individual lines in the LIBRS Flat File that contain varying information about the incident. Those bits of information are bound by the LIBRS Data Elements and their definitions/available values.

The information from an RMS needs to be output to the LIBRS Flat File in the exact specifications that are listed in this document. If not, a number of errors will occur. These errors and their common causes and resolutions can be found in the [Data Elements Defintions](./librs-spec/#librs-data-element-definitions) section of this page.

In the event that no incident data is present for submission, the LIBRS Flat File should contain two Segments followed by a blank line (three lines in total):

    Submission Header (00)
	    Submission Trailer (99)
	    [Blank Line]

Alternative Zero Submission Format (Both behave the same way, use whatever works best for you):

    Submission Header (00)
	    Zero Record (01)
	    Submission Trailer (99)

Whenever you are submitting a file with data, however, the following segments should always be included for all Incidents that have a value of 'I' for [DE C5](./librs-spec#action-type-c5):

    00 - Submission Header
	    10 - Administrative Segment
	    20 - Offense Segment
	    40 - Offender Segment
	    41 - Offender Using Segment/Gaming Motivation
	    50 - Victim Segment
	    99 - Submission Trailer

Whenever you want to submit a Deletion to us (used to either permanently remove an Incident from being reported, or simply to delete and re-add because there are changes that have been made to the Incident that need to be reflected) you need to ensure the following is included:

    00 - Submission Header
	    10 - Administrative Segment (With DE C5 - Action Type = 'D')
	    99 - Submission Trailer

Please note in all of these cases, the Submission Header and Trailer should only occur once per file. You can use any of the action types in the same Flat File. For instance, you can include all of the Deletes you'd like to make and the top of the file (after the Submission Header) and then follow it up with all of the Insertions that you'd like to make, or if you prefer include the Delete line just before the Insertion Segments for the Incident; it's purely personal preference.

# LIBRS Segments

---

LIBRS, like NIBRS, it built up on Segments that contain different information about the Incidents that are being reported. This portion of this document outlines the LIBRS Segments, and the building blocks (Referred to as Data Elements) That make them up.

## Submission Header (00)

---

### Description

The Submission Header contains the information related to the Agency that is submitting the LIBRS Flat File, as well as information about the file itself, such as the Reporting Period it encompasses and the Spec Version that it was generated with (Currently we are only accepting LIBRS Spec 2.5)

## Zero Record (01)

---

### Description

Segment 01 is used when there are no Incidents to report; IE a Zero Report. The segment can only be used when there are no Incidents present in the Flat File; there cannot be any Segments present other than 00, 01, and 99:

* -Header Segment-
* 01000000000000ZZ
* 99000003ZZ

## Administrative (10)

---

### Description

The Administrative Segment contains basic information about the Incident that is being reported. It acts as the indication for LIBRS that a the next portion of Information is for a different incident from the previous on that was processed. This segment should always be included when:

* Performing an Action Type of 'I - Insertion' for an Incident.
* Performing a 'D - Deletion' Action Type for an Incident.
  * If you desire to delete and resubmit the Incident (easiest way to process changes for us), then simply insert a Segment 10 with a 'D' as [DE C5](./librs-spec#action-type-c5) , followed by the whole incident again (including another Segment 10 with a 'I' for [C5](./librs-spec#action-type-c5)).

## Administrative Modification (11)

---

### Description

Segment 11, Administrative Modification, is only used when performing an update to a Time Window Submission Incident (DE C5, Action Type = ‘M’). Agencies should be aware that information submitted via time windows is stored separately by the FBI and is not combined back in with normal submissions and may or may not be reported in some publications  nor counted towards overall totals.

## Offense (20)

---

### Description

Segment 20, Offense Segment, contains information about the particular Offenses that occurred in the Incident. Note that only one Victim can be tied to an Offense, so if you have multiple Victims of the same Offense you will need to include multiple Segment 20's to link those Victims to the Offense.

We get a lot of questions about this Segment, and have included more information about it in the FAQ, which can be found [here](./faq#offenses-segment-20).

### Important Notes

* Only one Victim can be related to an Offense Segment. If you have multiple Victims of the same offense, you need to include multiple Offense Segments that link to those Victims.
* Please note that DE's 12 and 13 are actually three Data Elements Combined into one. Each instance of the Data Element is either 1 or 3 characters long and can include up to 3 instances, so long as mutually exclusive values are not used.
  * See [Type of Criminal Activity/Gang Information Nos. 1, 2 and 3](./librs-spec#type-of-criminal-activitygang-information-12) and [Type of Weapon/Force Involved Nos. 1, 2, and 3 ](./librs-spec#type-of-weaponforce-involved-nos-1-2-and-3-13) for more details.

## Property (30)

---

### Description

Segment 30, Property Segment, is used to identify that Properties are involved in the listed Offenses. It only contains general information about these Properties, such as the number of Stolen or Recovered Vehicles. Further Details are expected to be entered in Segments 31, 32, and 33.

We get a lot of questions about this Segment, and have included more information about it in the FAQ, which can be found [here](./faq#properties-segments-30-31-32-and-33).

***Note: There should only be ONE Segment 30 per Incident***

## Property/Offense (33)

---

### Description

Segment 33, Property/Offense Relationship, is used to distinctly relate a Property to an Offense. This Segment is not mandatory, though you will most likely experience Errors if you do not include it.

When this segment is not included, LIBRS will perform a Cross Product between all Properties and all Offenses. We have measures in place to help limit incorrect Properties from being associted with Invalid Offenses (EG: Drugs being associated with Motor Vehicle Theft Offenses), however the best way to ensure that Properties are being appropriately linked up to their Offenses is by including a Segment 33 for each Property/Offense Relationship.

We get a lot of questions about this Segment, and have included more information about it in the FAQ, which can be found [here](./faq#properties-segments-30-31-32-and-33).

#### Important Notes:

* The Property/Offense Segment is used to connect incident property (stolen, retrieved, etc.) to an offense. This connection, or relationship, is established using the Property Sequence Number (Data Element P1) and the Offense Sequence Number (Data Element L6).
* This Segment *is optional* in the sense that if it is missing LIBRS will interpret properties to offenses automatically using a cross product (EG all offenses are associated with all properties). Depending on the Offenses in the Incident, this can cause LIBRS to infer properties to incompatible Offenses.
* LIBRS uses the NIBRS Code of the Offenses to determine if it should apply properties to them to minimize the cases that this happens in. However, there are some NIBRS Codes that include both 'Crimes Against People' and 'Crimes Against Property' Offenses.
  * EG: 13B Contains both LRS 14:35 (Simple Battery - Crime Against Person) as well as LRS 14:60 (Aggravated Burglary - Crime Against Property) that break this assumption. Therefore it is always best to include this Segment when Properties are involved.

#### Successful Segment 33 Inference Example

An incident is submitted with a NIBRS 23H 'Crime Against Property' Offense, as well as a NIBRS 11A 'Crime Against Person' Offense, along with one or more properties that are intended to be linked to the 23H Offense. Since NIBRS 11A has no related Offenses that are a 'Crime Against Property', if Segment 33 is missing LIBRS knows that it should not apply the properties to the 11A Offense. As a result, LIBRS will only infer the properties to be related to the 23H Offense, successfully validating the Incident submission.

#### Unsuccessful Segment 33 Inference Example

An incident is submitted with a NIBRS 23H 'Crime Against Property' Offense, as well as a NIBRS 13B 'Crime Against Person' Offense, along with one or more properties that are intended to be linked to the 23H Offense. Since 13B has some offenses that are 'Crime Against Property', if Segment 33 is missing LIBRS cannot know that it shouldn't apply the properties to the 13B Offense. As a result, LIBRS will interpret all properties to be related to all offenses, which in this case will throw validation errors.

### Ivalid Combinations of NIBRS Offense Codes and Property Descriptions

There are a number of illogical combinations for various NIBRS Offense Codes (Data Element 6) having certain Property Descriptions (Data Element 15). For example, it is illogical for Purse Snatching (NIBRS Code 23B) to be connected to property having a Property Description data value of Aircraft (01) or Livestock (18).

The table below shows invalid combinations of NIBRS Offense Codes and Property Descriptions. X's on this table represent that the combination of the Property Description and NIBRS Code are incompatible and should **NOT** be used together.

## Offender (40)

---

### Description

Segment 40, Offender Segment, is used to submit information about the suspected Offender(s) that are involved in an Incident. You should have as many Offender Segments as you have Suspects.

Offenders are linked to their Offenses by their Victims. Segment 20 - Offense Segment contains a Victim Sequence Number that denotes who the victim of the Offense was. Segment 52 - Victim/Offender Relationship then links the Offender to the Victim, which, in turn, links the Offender to the Offense.

More information and common questions and errors can be found on the LIBRS FAQ for this Segment [here](./faq#offenders-segments-40-and-41).

## Victim (50)

---

### Description

Segment 50, Victim Segment, is used to report the relevent personal attributes of the Victims of the Offenses in the Incident. You should have as many Segment 50's as you have unique Victims. This means you should not repeat Society as a Victim for each Offense that is a Crime Against Society, and instead only have a single Segment 50 to represent it.

More information and common questions and errors can be found on the LIBRS FAQ for this Segment [here](./faq#victims-segments-50-51-and-52).

### Important Notes

* [Data Element 31 - Aggrevated Assault/Homicide Circumstance](./librs-spec#nos.-1-and-2-31) is repeated twice. In the past this was repeated three times, however this has since been eliminated, which has resulted in a blank space on Characters 48 and 49.

## Victim Injury (51)

---

### Description

Segment 51, Victim Injury, includes information about the sustained Injuries of a Victim of an Offense.

The main thing to note about it is that it required to be included when a Segment 50 (Victim Segment) is present with a Victim Type of 'I - Individual' or 'L - Law Enforcement', and the Offense is of one of the following NIBRS Codes:
{::nomarkdown}`<script>`document.write(window.derequiresnibrs.de33)`</script>`{:/}

Otherwise, it should NOT be included. Additionally, you should not supply a Segment 51 without an Injury Type (DE 33).

More information and common questions and errors can be found on the LIBRS FAQ for this Segment [here](./faq#victims-segments-50-51-and-52).

## Victim/Offender Relation (52)

---

### Description

Segment 52, Victim/Offender Relationship, is what links the Victims to the Offenders, and thereby links the Offenders to the Offenses.

If a Victim of Type 'I - Individual' or 'L - Law Enforcement' is present in the Incident, and the Offense is a Crime Against Person or a Robbery, then this Segment needs to be included. Otherwise it should NOT be included.

More information and common questions and errors can be found on the LIBRS FAQ for this Segment [here](./faq#victims-segments-50-51-and-52).

## Arrestee (60)

---

### Description

Segment 60, Arrestee Segment, is used to define whether or not an Offender was arrested for an Offense or not. Since Offenders can be known but not apprehended, there needs to be another Segment that details the information about their Arrest when the time comes.

Segment 60 can also be used with Action Type 'A - Arrest' in order to add Arrest Information to an already submitted Incident. Though, it's recommended to simply generate a Delete for the Incident and then resubmit it.

You should include an Arrestee Segment for each Offender that has been arrested in relation to an Offense. While NIBRS allows Arrestees to not be linked to an Offender (EG Someone that's not listed on the Incident is listed as the arrestee for it), LIBRS does not allow this. Any Arrestee that's present in this Segment should also have a Segment 40 (Offender) associated with them.

### Important Notes

* [Data Element 52 - Disposition of Arrestee Under 18](./librs-spec#disposition-of-arrestee-under-18-52) must be included for any arrestee that is ***17 or younger***.
  * Previously, Louisiana Law stated that 17 Year Olds were Adults rather than Juveniles, however this changed in 2020, which has led to a bit of confusion about this Data Element.
* [Data Element 44 - Multiple Arrestee Indicator](./librs-spec#multiple-arrestee-segment-indicator-44) should be used when an Offender is Arrested and associated with more than one Incident. The arrest of the Individual will clear all Incidents that they are a part of, however it should not be counted that two arrests were made. The Multiple Arrestee Indicator allows you to specify that an individual was arrested for another Incident, which has cleared this Incident by arrest, but to not count this arrest for Crime Statistics.

### Important Notes

* [Data Element C7 - Number of Segments Transferred](./librs-spec#number-of-segments-transferred-c7) should be a six-digit long number that is front-padded with 0's that contains the number of lines in the Flat File (Including the Header and Trailer Segments). For instance, if Segment 99 appears on line number 512 in your Flat File, DE C7 should be '000512', and the full line would read '99000512ZZ' (plus Padding to make 150 characters).

<div class="newpage"></div>

## Incident Number (2)

---

**Description:** Agency unique, in-house assigned case number. It is used to link subsequent update submissions to the original submission. This number will be encrypted prior to any dissemination of data to ensure that the recipient cannot identify the actual case.

### Definitions:

**Concept of time and place provides:** If more than one crime was committed by the same person or group of persons and the time and space intervals separating them were insignificant, all of the crimes make up a single incident.

**An incident is considered as one or more offenses committed by the same offender or group of offenders acting in concert at the same time and place.**

Acting in concert requires that the offenders actually commit or assist in the commission of the crime(s). The offenders must be aware of, and consent to, the commission of the crime(s); or, even if non-consenting, their actions assist in the commission of the offense(s). This is important because all of the offenders in an incident are considered to have committed all of the offenses in the incident. If one or more of the offenders did not act in concert, then there is more than one incident involved.

**Same time and place means that the time interval between the offenses and the distancebetween the offenses and the distance between the locations where they occurred were insignificant.**

Normally, the offenses must have occurred during an unbroken time duration and at the same or adjourning location(s). However, incidents can also be comprised of offenses which by their nature involve continuing criminal activity by the same offender(s) at different times and places, as long as the activity is deemed to constitute a single criminal transaction. Regarding these situations, the reporting agency will have to use its best judgment.

<br>

<div class="newpage"></div>

## Incident Date/Hour (3)

---

**Description:** Date and Time when the incident occurred or started, or at the beginning of the time period in which it occurred, or date of report if unknown. If an incident occurred before the agency's Base Date it should not be reported to LIBRS; it will be rejected if it is. For the most part, this really isn't an issue, as the Base Date for most agencies is from somewhere in 2012. However if you do run into an error regarding it, then you should remove that Incident from being reported.

**Data Characteristics:** 11 Character Alpha. If Unknown, Enter the Reporting Date (MMDDYYYY) followed by an 'R' to indicate the date is not the actual Incident Date, but rather the Reporting Date. Leave the Time blank in this case (Not 0's, but Blank Spaces)

**Format:** MMDDYYYYXHH, Where 'X' is either:

* 'R' to denote that the Incident Date is not known, and the Report Date is being substituted for it
* Or ' ' (G - Blank Space) to denote that the supplied value is the actual Incident Date.

### Important Note:

* In the process to certify an agency as LIBRS-compliant, when an agency reaches the Certification and Production stages, please note the following:
  * The "Base Date" for an agency is the date that agency starts sending actual, live data that both the State and FBI Retain. For most Agencies, this is the date in which they started sending UCR data.
  * If an incident occurred before the agency's "Base Date", but was not reported to LIBRS until after your "Base Date" has been implemented; or this incident was already reported in the UCR summary reports, this incident will be REJECTED **(Error 11073)**.
  * If this happens, contact a member of the LIBRS staff at the Louisiana Commission on Law Enforcement.
  * If this incident was not reported until after your "Base Date" was implemented, your agency may have to submit an adjusted UCR summary form to capture these offenses.

* If the Incident occurred on or between midnight and 0059, enter "00" for the hour; if on or between 0100 and 0159, enter "01" for the hour if on or between 2300 and 2359, enter "23" for the hour, etc.
* If the Incident occurred at exactly midnight, it is considered to have occurred at the beginning of the next day. Therefore "00" should be entered for the hour, along with the next day's date.
* If the Incident Date is unknown, enter the date of the report with the indicator "R" = Report after the MMDDYYYY of the Report Date.
* If the Incident hour is unknown, leave the hour blank.
* When LIBRS requires a Blank (G), it must be a Blank (G), NOT A ZERO.

### Details:

* The Cleared Exceptionally data element indicates if the incident has been cleared by an exceptional event such as the death of the offender, and if so, the reason for the clearance. In multiple offense incidents, the exceptional clearance of one offense clears the entire incident. An incident CANNOT BE CLEARED EXCEPTIONALLY if it was previously, or at the same time, cleared by an arrest, (that is, if an Arrestee Segment was or is being submitted).
* In order to clear an offense by exceptional means, ALL of the following four conditions must be met:
  * The investigation must have clearly and definitely established the identity of at least one offender.
  * Sufficient probable cause must have been developed to support the arrest, charging, and prosecution of the offender.
  * The exact location of the offender must be known so that an arrest could be made.
  * There must be a reason outside the control of law enforcement that prevents arresting, charging, and prosecuting the offender.
* DO NOT report exceptional clearance information for justifiable homicide, as no crimes have occurred, in reality.
* The closing of a case or the clearing of it by an agency's policy does not permit exceptionally clearing an offense unless all four conditions are met.

## Exceptional Cleared Date (5)

**Description:** The Exceptional Clearance Date is the date that the Agency was made aware that an Incident has been cleared by exceptional measures (EG: If cleared by Death of Offender, it is not the Offenders date of Death, but rather when the Agency was made aware that the case was no longer active because of it). If The Incident is not Cleared by Exceptional Means, then this Data Element should remain blank. Do not fill it with all Zero's or any placeholder characters other than Blank Spaces.

**Data Characteristics**: 8 Character Date in the MMDDYYYY Format. If the Incident is not Cleared Exceptionally, then this Data Element should be Blank Spaces, otherwise this Data Element should be present.

## Offense Sequence Number (L6)

---

**Description:** The Offense Sequence Number is a Uniquely Identifying Value between 001 and 999 that is used throughout the LIBRS Data Segments to identify which particular Offense is being referenced for validation purposes. Each Offense Segment (Segment 20) in an Incident should contain a unique Sequence Number.

**Data Characteristics:** 3 Character Numeric. Cannot be blank and should always be a three-digit number, front-padded with zeros as needed (EG Offense Sequence Number 1 of the Incident would be 001)

## Offense Sequence Number Reference (L6R)

---

**Description:** Offense Sequence Number Reference is used in Segment 33 to relate Properties and Offenses together. It has to match one of the Offense Sequence Numbers (DE L6) that are present in the Segment 20(s) of the Incident, and since it's used to relate Properties to Offenses, the same L6R can be used in Multiple Segment 33's to relate multiple Properties to the Offense.

**Data Characteristics:** 3 Character Numeric, front-padded with Zeros to make a three-digit number (EG Sequence Number 1 would be 001). Must be included in each Segment 33 of the Incident and cannot be left blank or all zeros (000).

### Requirements:

## Louisiana Revised Statute (6)

---

**Description:** The Louisiana Revised Statute (LRS) Code is the State Statute that and Offender is being charged and/or Arrested for. The [Master LRS List](./lrs-master-list) contains the list of all available LRS Codes that LIBRS is able to have reported to it. Each of these LRS Codes have NIBRS Code(s) associated with them. This allows Officers to report the crime how they intended to the FBI. EG: LRS 14:59/A9 is used to denote that someone shot a firearm at a train. Depending on the circumstances, the Officer may want to report this crime as a Weapons Violation (520) or as a Descrution of Property/Vandalism (290).

LRS Codes also have Subparts and Qualifiers that can be associated with them. These, similarly to the NIBRS Code, allow the Officer to more descriptively report what happened for Statutes that have a broad stroke of ways that it could be violated. More information on Subparts and Qualifiers is below.

**Data Characteristics**: 12 Character Alpha. Cannot be left blank and can only contain one (1) Hyphen (-).

**Format**: TT:SSSS.S/P-I

### Qualifiers and Subparts

Qualifiers and Subparts are additional information that is added to the tail-end of an LRS Code to give more definition about it whenever a statute contains multiple cases that could be reported as different NIBRS Codes. For instance, LRS 14:67 is generally used for Theft, however the item that is being stolen can cause the NIBRS Code that should be used to change (EG: A 14:67 with a 240 NIBRS Code is for if a vehicle is stolen, while a 14:67 with a 23H)

|       1       | When 14:42 is submitted as a Louisiana Revised Statute LRS (6), LIBRS will need Qualifiers to determine if the offense should be classified as a forcible rape or as a forcible sodomy. If the offense is submitted as a**14:42/V**, this would translate to a forcible rape offense, whereas if this offense is submitted as a **14:42/A** this would translate to a forcible sodomy offense.`<br><br>`Without any Qualifiers, LIBRS has no way to determine which offense this LRS should be reported as, and the entire incident would be rejected. The agency will receive the following error message: 'This LRS Code must be submitted with a Qualifier to define offense applicable.' |
|       2       | If an incident involved a robbery (14:64) and a forcible rape (**14:42.1/V**), two LRS offenses should be submitted.

## Agency Supplied NIBRS Code (N6)

---

**Description:** The NIBRS Code that the Agency Supplies is what drives LIBRS Validation. The LRS Code is important to us for analytics purposes, however we use the NIBRS Code to effectively categroize LRS Codes into kinds of offenses, and then perform validation based on which category the LRS Code falls into.

The NIBRS Code also allows Officers to report Offenses in a more specific manner without having to go through the trouble of Subparts and Qualifiers.

**Data Characteristics:** 3 Character AlphaNumeric. Check [here](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/ucr/ucr-2019-1-nibrs-technical-specification.pdf) for a list of the current NIBRS Codes.

## Offense Attempted/Completed (7)

---

**Description:** Attempted/Completed is how to designate whether or not an Offense occurred to completion, or was merely attempted by the Offender. For instance, an Offender tries to steal a car, but is caught in the act by the police. Since the Offender didn't succeed in stealing the car, this offense would be Attempted.

The only thing to note about this is that Attempted Murder (Attempted 09A) should be reported as a Completed Aggravated Assault (Completed 13A). NIBRS does not allow for 09A Offenses to be Attempted, so instead it should be reported as a Completed Aggravated Assault -- Otherwise, the Offense is reported in the standard fashion.

**Data Characteristics:** 1 Character Alpha. Cannot be left blank, and must have a value of either:

* A - Attempted
* C - Completed

## Offender Suspected of Using/Gaming Motivation (8)

---

**Description:** Offender Suspected of Using/Gaming Motivation gives more context to the Offenses that are being reported. It tells us if an Offender is suspected of being on Drugs/Narcotics or has consumed Alcohol either during or shortly before the Incident Occurred. It also gives context of whether Computer Equipment was used to perpetrate the Crime, and if a Gaming/Gambling activity was a motivating factor in committing the crime.

**Data Characteristics:** Up to 4x, 1 Character Alpha. If you use 'N', then you cannot use any other values, and values cannot repeat (EG: AAGG and CGN are both invalid combinations). At least one value is required to be present, but the other three slots are optional and can be left blank if nothing else applies. If another value does apply, then the mutual exclusivity and duplicate rules need to be followed.

## Bias Motivation/Bias Crime Type (8A)

---

**Description:** Bias Motivation/Crime Type gives insight into the motivation behind an Offender committing a crime. For instance, if the Offender committed the crime because of the Race or Religion of the Victim, that should be noted here.

**Data Characteristics:** 2 Character Alpha. Must be present and can't be blank. If there is no reason to suspect the Offender had a Bias Type against the Victim use '88' for None, but if not enough information is known about the Offender to determine whether or not a Bias Type was a factor in them committing the crime, use '99' for Unknown.

---

### Details:

* Bias Motivation/Bias Crime Type (8) indicates an Offender's motivation to commit an offense because of their bias against a Victim's race, religion, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, disability group, or other bias.
* Because of the difficulty in ascertaining the Offender's subjective motivation, bias is to be reported only when an investigation reveals sufficient objective facts to lead a reasonable and prudent person to conclude that the Offender's actions were motivated, in whole or in part, by bias.
* In LIBRS, incidents not having facts that indicate biased motivation on the part of the Offender are to be coded as None (88), while incidents involving ambiguous facts (that is, where some facts are present, but not conclusive) are to be coded Unknown (99).
* If any Bias Motivation/Bias Crime Type codes are used, other than None (88) or Unknown (99), then the incident will be considered a hate crime, and the Louisiana Revised Statute (DE 6) probably should be appended with the Hate Crime Penalty Enhancer (-H) to represent enhanced penalties related to hate crimes in LRS 14:107.2.

|       1       | An assault started in a bar ('03'), continued into an adjoining parking lot ('18'), and ended in the street ('13').

|       2       | Two Offenders robbed a bar. One of the Offenders raped a female customer in the bar while the other Offender stood at the door with a gun. In this case, there is one incident, with two offenses: robbery and forcible rape. The location of the robbery would be Bar/Night Club ('03'), and the location of the forcible rape would also be Bar/Night Club ('03'). |

<div class="newpage"></div>

## Number of Premises Entered (10)

---

**Description:** Number of Premises Entered is only to be used if the Incident contains a NIBRS 220 (Burglary) Offense, and the Location Type (DE 9) is 14 or 19. It is the number of individual/separate dwellings or units that were stolen from in the 220 Offense. For instance, a single Hotel may have been burgled, but a dozen units in that hotel were stolen from. Rather than 12 Offenses with the same location, you should use one Offense with a 12 in this Data Element.

This Data Element should be left blank if the 220 Offense did not happen in a Hotel/Motel or Storage Facility, because these are the only two Location Types that can contain multiple, separate dwellings/units at the same address (Apartments each have an Apartment Number that you can send mail to, and therefore can be considered to be different places for the Time and Place consideration).

**Data Characteristics:** 2 Character Numeric. If the described conditions don't apply, then this value should be left as Blank Spaces (G). Otherwise it should include a two digit number, using 01, 02, 03, etc... for single-digit numbers.

### Details:

* This data element is used only if the offense is burglary and the "Hotel Rule" is applicable.  In such cases, the number of structures (premises) entered is to be reported.  If the LRS offense (6) is not reportable as a Burglary (NIBRS 220), then this data element MUST be left blank.
* In the Summary UCR Reporting System, the "Hotel Rule" is only applied to temporary lodging.  It states: If a number of dwelling units under a single manager are burglarized, then the offenses are most likely to be reported to the police by the manager rather than the individual tenants. The burglary should be reported as a single offense.  The total number of individual rooms, units, storage compartments, etc. entered is to be reported into this data element.
* In LIBRS the "Hotel Rule" has been expanded to include rental storage facilities, i.e., "mini-storage" and "self storage" buildings.

## Method of Entry (11)

---

**Description:** Method of Entry should only be used when there is an Offense Type of NIBRS 220. Unlike Number of Premises Entered (DE 10), there is no restriction on if it can only be used with certain Location Types. Any location Type that is valid for use in a Burglary should include this Data Element. The available values are 'F' for Forced Entry (breaking of a window or door to gain access) and 'N' for Non-Forced Entry (picking a lock or going through an open window to gain access).

**Data Characteristics:** 1 Character Alpha. Should be left blank unless the NIBRS Code is a 220 (Burglary) Offense.

### Details:

* This data element is to report whether force or no force was used by the burglar(s) to enter the structure.
* A forced entry is where force of any degree, or a mechanical contrivance of any kind (including a passkey or skeleton key), was used to unlawfully enter a building or other structure.
* An unforced entry is one where the unlawful entry was achieved without force through an unlocked door or window.
* If both forced and unforced entries were involved in the crime, the entry should be reported as having been accomplished through "Force".

## Type of Criminal Activity/Gang Information (12)

Type of Criminal Activity and Gang Information are combined into a single Data Element. This portion is split into two sections to outline the requirements for each. Which aspect of the Data Element should be used is dependent on the NIBRS Code of the Offense.

## Type of Criminal Activity Nos. 1, 2 and 3 (12)

---

**Description:** Type of Criminal Activity is used to add context to Offenses for when they're passed on to the FBI. For instance, a 35A Offense could just as easily be a single person with some Marijuana on them, or a major drug bust with millions of Dollars of narcotics involved. Adding a value here gives the FBI that context when it comes to Offenses that can be open-ended like that.

**Data Characteristics**: Up to 3x, 1 Character Alpha. If none apply, then leave this Data Element blank. If more than one apply, then make sure that there aren't any duplicate values being reported (EG: BBB).

### Requirements (Criminal Activity):

---

The following requirements are for **Type of Criminal Activity Only**:

|                  Requirement                  | Requirement Description  |   Error Number   | Error Message           |

### Details:

* This data element is used to enter the Type of Weapon/Force Used (13) by an Offender.
* Append an "A" if the weapon is automatic.
  * Any firearm that can fire more than one shot by a single pull of the trigger without manual reloading is classified as an Automatic Firearm.
* Something like a Bump Stock, which is designed to simulate Automatic Fire, should not be considered Automatic because it does not meet the requirement of a single trigger pull firing more than one round. Instead it is multiple trigger pulls that are in quick succession.

## Property Sequence Number (P1)

---

**Description:** Property Sequence Number is a uniquely identifying number for each Property that's included in the Incident. It is used to link Properties to Offenses in Segment 33's. The same Property Sequence Number can be used Multiple Times across Segment 33's in an Incident, because it's possible for a Property to be involved in more than one Offense.

**Data Characteristics:** 3 Character Numeric. Must be front-padded with zeros to make a three-digit number (EG: 1 would be 001). Must be unique for each Segment 31.

### Requirements :

---

|                  Requirement                  | Requirement Description  |   Error Number   | Error Message           |

---

### Details:

* Each property in an incident must be assigned a unique sequence number from "001" to "999".

---

<br>

## Property Sequence Number Reference (P1R)

**Description:** Property Sequence Number Reference is only used in Segment 33 to link Properties to Offenses. It should be present in each Segment 33 in the Incident, and should refernce the value of one of the Property Seqence Numbers (DE P1) in the Property Description Segments (Segment 31).

**Data Characteristics:** 3 Character Numeric. Must be front-padded with zeros to make a three-digit number (EG: 1 would be 001). May repeat across multiple Segment 33's, as a single property can be involved in more than one Offense.

### Requirements :

### Details:

* Type of Property Loss (14) describes the various type(s) of property loss that can occur during an incident, such as Recovery, Seizure, etc.
* Every different type of property loss that occurs during an incident must be submitted in a separate Property Description Segment (31), when the incident involved one or more of the Offenses listed above. For instance if a Property is stolen and then recovered, there should be two Property Description Segments (Segment 31) that have a Property Loss Type of 7 for Stolen and 5 for Recovered.

### Allowed Entries:

---

Enter only one (1) code for each Property Description Segment. However, as many property segments as applicable can be submitted per incident:

### Details:

* Property Description (DE 15) is to be used to enter descriptions of the property that was burned, counterfeited, destroyed/damaged/vandalized, etc., during, or as a result of, the incident.

### Allowed Entries:

---

* Enter only one Property Description (DE 15) code per Property Description (31) Segment, entering multiple Property Description (31) Segments for multiple Properties.
  * This also applies to multiples of Property Descriptions. You should submit a Segment 31 for each Property Involved in the Incident, even if it is the same as another Property.
    * EG: Three TV's are stolen from Best Buy. Being the same Make and Model, they all will have the same Description and Value, however you should submit three Property Description Segments to LIBRS.
* Do NOT enter duplicate Property Sequence Numbers (DE P1) within an incident unless a different Type of Property Loss (DE 14) is used.
  * EG: Just because those three TV's in the previous example are all the same make, model, and value, doesn't mean they should have the same Property Sequence Number.
* LIBRS will aggregate the counts of Property Descriptions and the Total Values associated with them for NIBRS Extraction. Therefore the FBI will not receieve this granular of data, however the State of Louisiana Will.

## Victim Sequence Number (23)

---

**Description:** Victim Sequence Number is the uniquely identifying ID for each Victim in an Incident. This number cannot repeat in the same incident, and must be unique for each Segment 50 that is present. This data Element can never be ommitted and must always have a value between 001 and 999.

**Data Characteristics:** 3 Character Numeric. Should be front-padded with Zero's (0) to make a three digit number. (EG: 1 would be 001).

### Requirements:

---

|                  Requirement                  | Requirement Description  |   Error Number   | Error Message           |

## Offense Connected to Victim Sequence Number (24)

---

**Description:** Offense Connected to Victim Sequence Number is only used in Offense Segments Segmetn 20). Each Offense can only be related to a single Victim, so if there are multiple Victims of the same Offense, or Multiple Offenses for the same Victim, you'll need multiple Segment 20's to reference that. This Data Element is important because it's what's used to link the Offenders to their Offenses.

**Data Characteristics:** 3 Character Numeric. Should be front-padded with Zero's (0) to make a three digit number. (EG: 1 would be 001). Needs to match a Victim Sequence Number (DE 23) that's present in a Segment 50 of the Incident.

### Requirements:

|                  Requirement                  | Requirement Description  |   Error Number   | Error Message           |

* DEFINITION: A Justifiable Homicide is the killing of a perpetrator of a serious criminal offense by a peace officer in the line of duty; or the killing, during the commission of a serious criminal offense, of the perpetrator by a private individual.
* At MOST, TWO Assault Circumstances (31) are allowed. Beginning with LIBRS 2.5 Specifications, the third Assault Circumstance is ignored. *New Warning Message in LIBRS 2.5*
* Aggravated Assault/Homicide Circumstances and Law Enforcement Officers Killed/Assaulted (InLine of Duty (31) describes the circumstances of either an Aggravated Assault or Homicide.
* Assault on Law Enforcement Officer is a new Aggravated Assault and Non-Negligent Manslaughter Circumstance,beginning with LIBRS Spec 2.5.
* The crime being committed when the Justifiable Homicide took place MUST BE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE INCIDENT. These instructions are based on the definition of an "incident". Therefore, Justifiable Homicide cases involve two incidents rather than one.
  * For the Justifiable Homicide incident, code the police officer or the civilian who killed the criminal as the "Offender" and the criminal who was killed as the "Victim".
    * The Justifiable Homicide incident IS NOT CLEARED EXCEPTIONALLY, as no crime has occurred in reality.
    * In the second incident, report the Offense(s) that were being committed when the Justifiable Homicide occurred.

### Important Note:

13A, 13B, and 13C Offenses are all Mutually Exclusive to the same Victim in the same Incident. Meaning, LIBRS (and NIBRS, for that matter) will not allow you to submit a Victim who received Major Injuries from one Offender committing a 13A - Aggravated Assault Offenses, and Minor Injuries from another Offender committing a 13B - Simple Assault Offense.

If you have a case where a Victim applies to Mutually Exclusive Offenses, then you will need to submit those Offenses in Separate Incidents. You can see the chart here for [which Offenses are Mutually Exclusive](#offenses-that-cannot-occur-to-the-same-victim).

### Details:

* Notes: This Data Element (32) describes the type(s) of bodily injury suffered by a person.
* Minor injury is described as an injury not requiring immediate medical attention.
* Major injury is described as an injury requiring immediate medical attention.

## Offender Sequence Number (36)

---

**Description:** Offender Sequence Number is the unique identifier for each Offender that is present in an Incident. Each Offender Segment (Segment 40) should have a unique value to identify them. Values for Offenders that aren't unknown should be between 001 and 999. If an Offender is unknown, then there should be a single Segment 40 with an Offender Sequence Number of '000'.

An Unknown Offender Sequence Number '000' is different than an Unknown Age, Race, or Sex ('00' for Age, or 'U' for Race and Sex) of an Offender. Take the following examples:

1. A vehicle is stolen, and there are no witnesses or camera footage of the crime.
2. A crime that was caught on camera, but the resolution wasn't good enough to make out any identifying features of the Suspects.

Case 1 would be a case where you use '000' for an Offender Sequence Number. When '000' is used as the Offender Sequence Number, it basically means "We have no idea who, or even how many people were involved in this crime". Because of that, there are two circumstances that should be accounted for with it:

1. If '000' is used as an Offender Sequence Number, then no other Offender Sequence Numbers can be entered. You either have an idea of how many people were invovled, or you don't. If you know something about any of the Offenders, or even just how many Offenders were involved, '000' should not be used.
2. '000' is not allowed for 09C Offenses because inherently you need to know who was involved in that Offense to deem it a Justifiable Homicide; if you don't know who was involved, then what evidence do you have that the homicide was justifiable?

Case 2 is a case where '000' Offender Sequence Number shouldn't be confused for not knowing anything about the *attributes* (Age, Sex, and Race) of the Offenders involved. In this case you may not be able to describe anything about the Offenders, but you have clear-cut evidence about the number of Offenders that were involved. Therefore you should use Offender Sequence Numbers other than '000' for them.

Just to note, you will get a Warning about those attributes being Unknown, but that's only there to warn the User in case that data was mistakenly forgotten, which is the most common occurance when all of those Data Elements are Unknown.

**Data Characteristics:** 3 Character Numeric. Should never be left blank and should be front-padded to make a three-digit number. EG: 1 would be 001. If unknown use '000' - If '000' is used then no other Offender Segments can be present.

## Date of Birth of Offender (L37)

---

**Description:** DOB of Offender is not a required field, but if the Date of Birth is known then it can be entered here in the MMDDYYYY Format. If this field has a value, then you shouldn't be using an Estimated age in Data Element 37 (Age of Offender), however we don't stop that because it's possible the exact Incident Date is Unknown, and instead the Reporting Date is being used. For that reason we allow Estimated Ages to also have a Date of Birth present.

**Data Characteristics:** 8 Character Date. Optional, if not entered should be all Blank Spaces (Not Zeros)

**Format:** MMDDYYYY

## Arrestee Name (L40)

---

**Description:** Arrestee Name is the name of the individual being Arrested in connection with one of the Offenses present in the Incident. This field is purely optional, we do literally no validation on it and it doesn't go to the FBI for NIBRS Reporting.

**Data Characteristics:** 20 Character Alpha

**Format:** [Last Name][Suffix],[First Name][Middle Name]

Suffix includes standard suffixes used to distinguish between generations (for example, Sr, Jr, III, II). Do not include titles (for example, MD, M.E., Ph.D., Esq., etc.)

### Requirements:

---

None

---

### Details:

* If Arrestee's full name will not fit in the field, then enter as much as possible. DO NOT put periods behind suffix abbreviations or middle initial.

## Arrest Number/Local Booking Number for Arrest (41)

---

**Description:** Arrest Number/Local Booking Number for Arrest is the unique identifier that the Agency has for the particular Arrest Record in their RMS. This is actually quite an important Data Element, as when we submit changes to NIBRS to arrests this is the value that is used to make modifications.

**Data Characteristics:** 12 Character Alpha. Cannot be completely blank, and must be unique for every Arrestee across all Incidents (IE: Number cannot be the same in two different Incidents). Cannot contain spaces *in between* any of the characters in this data element, but leading or trailing spaces are fine.

### Requirements:

---

---

<br>

<div class="newpage"></div>

## Arrest Date (42)

---

**Description:** Arrest Date is the actual date that an Arrestee was brought into the LEA's custody. Since Incident Dates and Arrest Dates can be different, if there is a case where an Arrest is made for an Incident that occurred before the Agency's Base Date (Date where the agency began reporting either LIBRS or UCR data to the State), then the Arrest should not be sent to us.

**Data Characteristics:** 8 Character Date. Must be included and cannot be Blank or all Zeros.

**Format:** MMDDYYYY

## Multiple Arrestee Segment Indicator (44)

---

**Description:** The Multiple Arrestee Indicator is used to Identify if arresting an Offender for One Incident has cleared another Incident by arrest. In cases where an individual that is arrested is a suspect in more than one Incident, the Multiple Arrestee Indicator allows the agency to denote that one or more Incidents involving the Offender have been cleared by an Arrest, however the individual was not arrested multiple times.

For instance, if an Suspect already has a warrant out for their arrest, and they are then arrested for another Offense in a different Incident, the Incident that caused the warrant to be issued is now cleared by arrest, as well. However, the Suspect was only arrested one time. So the Multiple Arrestee Indicator allows the Agency to specify that both incidents have been cleared, but only one arrest was made.

**Data Characteristics:** 1 Character Alpha. Required for Each Segment 60 (Arrest Segment) that is present in the Incident.

### Requirements:

---

|                  Requirement                  | Requirement Description  |   Error Number   | Error Message           |

---

### Details:

* Multiple Arrestee Segment Indicator (44) ensures that an Arrestee is counted (scored) only once when the Arrestee's apprehension causes the Arresting Agency to submit two or more Arrestee Segments (60) concerning separate Incident Reports. That is, the Arrestee was involved in more than one crime incident and his/her arrest data are duplicated in each Incident Report.`
  * In such a situation, Count Arrestee ("C") is to be entered into one of the Arrestee Segments (60), and Multiple (M) is to be entered into all of the remaining Arrestee Segments (60).
  * If the Arrestee's apprehension DOES NOT cause the Arresting Agency to submit multiple Arrestee Segments (60), enter Not Applicable ("N").
* Count Arrestee ("C") and Multiple ("M") codes are to be used in this Data Element (44) ONLYwhen the same agency submits two or more Arrestee Segments (for different incidents) relating to the same Arrestee.

### Allowed Entries:

---

Enter only one (1) code per Arrestee Segment:

## Louisiana Revised Statute Number of Arrest (45)

---

**Description:** The LRS Number of Arrest is the Statute in which the Offender was Arrested For. It needs to match one of the Statutes that are present in the Offense Segments (Segment 20). NIBRS Doesn't have this restriction, and allows you to submit an Arrest for an Offense not related to the Incident, but LIBRS does not have this leniency.

**Data Characteristics:** 12 Character Alpha. Cannot be left blank and can only contain one (1) Hyphen (-).

**Format**: TT:SSSS.S/P-I

### Details:

* This Data Element records the Louisiana Revised Statute that the Arrestee was charged with.
* The structure of a Louisiana Revised Statute (LRS) is: Title (TT), followed by a colon, then a Section Number (SSSS.S), followed by optional Subparts, Qualifiers and Modifiers. Section and Subpart/Subpart with Qualifier/Qualifier/Juvenile Qualifier/Inchoate Modifier, should NOT be preceded by spaces or zeroes.
  * If there are no places after the decimal, then both the place after the decimal and the decimal point should be omitted.
    * For example, the LRS for Murder is 14:30 – two spaces for the Title (14), a colon, two spaces for the Section (30) before the decimal, not four spaces - 14:GG30 - and dropping the space after the decimal.
    * The field should be LEFT JUSTIFIED WITH NO INCLUDED SPACES. Spaces are interpreted as the End-of-Data in this data element.
* Subparts, Qualifiers, etc. are sometimes included for more specificity regarding those LRS codes requiring these identifiers. These parts of the field can be expanded or contracted as necessary to fill in the data.
* All local ordinances must be reported with the appropriate state statute as the base offense, with any Subparts, Qualifiers, etc. added when applicable.
  * When a parish statute does not correspond to a state LRS, the parish statute must be reported with a "P:" for the title and the parish statute following the colon.
  * If a city ordinance does not correspond to a state LRS, it must be reported by the police department with a "C:" substituted for the title portion of the data field, and the city ordinance following the colon.
    * When it is a Sheriff's Office, or any other law enforcement agency who has jurisdiction in more than one city, reporting the city ordinance, it should be reported with a "C#:" substituted for the title portion of the data field, and the city ordinance following the colon, where the "#" is replaced with a unique number for each city as decided by the agency and agreed upon by the state.

## Agency Supplied NIBRS Code For Arrest (N45)

---

**Description:** The Agency Supplied NIBRS Code For Arrest is the NIBRS Code with which the Agency would like to submit to the FBI as the Offense for the Arrest.

This Data Element was created before NIBRS Codes were mandatory, and we've since written code to use the NIBRS Code that's supplied in the Offense Segment if it's missing. However we would encourage you to include it as an extra measure to make certain the Arrest is being reported as desired.

**Data Characteristics:** 3 Character AlphaNumeric. Optional. If Inlcuded must be a NIBRS Code that's a Valid Mapping for the LRS Code for Arrest (DE 45). Refer to the [Master LRS List](./master-lrs-list) for more details.

**Description:** Arrest Connected to Offense is how an Arrestee gets linked to the Offense they were arrested for. It isn't just the Sequence Number. This Data Element allows you to link an Offense from Other Incidents, as well, to the Arrest performed in this one. Because of that the Incident Number in which the Offense was reported also needs to be included.

The format is simply the Offense Sequence Number (DE ) followed by the Incident Number (DE 3) that contains the Offense the Offender is being arrested for. EG If it's Offense Sequence Number 2, and the Incident Number is 20-000100-01, then this value would be '00220-000100-01'

**Data Characteristics:** 15 Character Alpha

### Requirements:

|                  Requirement                  | Requirement Description   |   Error Number   | Error Message           |

---

**MUST be a valid Offense Sequence Number (L6). The Offense Segment (20) referred to by this Data Element (L45) MUST exist.**

---

### Details:

* Arrest Connection to Offense (L45) relates an Arrest with the Offense giving rise to the Arrest. Indirectly, it also relates an Offender to his Victim. All Offenses should be included if a charge was added for the particular Offense, even those from different previous incidents.
  * The first three characters are the Offense Sequence Number (L6) of the Offense (6).
  * The next twelve characters are the Incident Number (2) of the Offense.
  * If Multiple Arrestee Segment Indicator (44) is anything except Not Applicable ("N") then this field will be connecting an Arrest to Offenses in two or more separate incidents.
  * The Incident Number (2) is appended to distinguish between Offense 001 in this incident and Offense 001 in a different incident.
    * The combined Offense Sequence Number (L6) and the Incident Number (2) add together to give a unique identifier (15 characters) indicating which Offense gave rise to the Arrest.
  * The Incident Number (2) can be omitted if Multiple Arrestee Segment Indicator (44) is Not Applicable ("N"), because all Offenses will be in the same incident. And therefore, the Incident Number (2) can be assumed to be that of the incident with which the Arrestee Segment (60) was submitted.

## Arrestee was Armed With [At Time of Arrest] (46)

---

**Description:** Arrestee was Armed With is used to report what, if anything, an Arrestee had on their person that was a Weapon whenever they were brought into custody. This Data Element is not as descriptive as Weapon/Type of Force Used (DE 13), but that's because it's limited to items that the Arrestee was *in possession of*.

***Please Note:*** Only one of each weapon type is currently reportable for each Arrestee. For instance, if an Arrestee had two Handguns on them at the time of Arrest, you should only list it once. Listing it twice will cause an error for Duplicate Values to be thrown. In the future we plan to add the ability to list the quantity of weapons found on the Arrestee, but at this time we can only allow a single one of each type to be reported.

**Data Characteristics:** 3 Character Alpha. Can't be blank, must have a selection. Third Character is reserved for the 'A - Automatic' designation, which is only to be used with Firearms. Otherwise, the third character is to be a Blank Space (G).

|       1       | When a man was arrested, he had in his possession a .357-Magnum handgun and a penknife. The entry should be Handgun ('12'). Because a small pocket knife is not generally considered to be a 'weapon', it does not qualify for reporting to LIBRS. |

### Details:

**Disposition of Arrestee Under 18** is a mandatory field for ANY Arrestee that is 17 years of age and younger. The Federal UCR program considers juveniles as under 18 years of  age regardless of state law. The LIBRS program will stay aligned with the FBI and collect this field for arrestees 17 and younger.  The Louisiana Juvenile Age definition has changed over the years to the following:

- Prior to March 1, 2019, the Juvenile age is 16 and younger.

- March 1, 2019 – April 18, 2024, the juvenile age is 17 and younger.

- After April 19, 2024, the Juvenile age is 16 and younger

After April 9, 2024 LIBRS will expect the 17 years old arrestees to have this data element and will reject the incident if this field is not provided..

---

### Details:

* Arrest Transaction Number (L55) is generated by the live scan when fingerprinting an Arrestee or is a pre-assigned number generated and assigned at the time of the fingerprinting. This ATN number is defined as:
  * Characters 1-4 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th characters of the ORI number of the agency that made the arrest, or where the live scan device is housed.
  * Character 5 live scan device number assigned to the device being used to generate this Arrestee's fingerprints.
  * Characters 6-7 indicates the year this Arrestee's fingerprints are being scanned into this device.
  * Characters 8-12 Arrest Sequence Number for this arrest event. This is a number counter that sequentially assigns a number to each arrest event
  * Characters 13-15 indicates the number of charges being assigned to this Arrestee at the time these fingerprints are being scanned. For instance, if an Arrestee is being charged with five counts of Aggravated Battery for this arrest, the numbers generated would be "001" through "005."

---

<div class="newpage"></div>

## Action Type (C5)

---

**Description:** Action Type designates what LIBRS should do with the Line of data that it's about to read. For modern implementations we would recommend only using 'I - Insert' and 'D - Delete', however in order to maintain support for older systems, we do still allow all Five (5) Action Types to be submitted.

The Types Available are:

* I - Insert
  * By far the most common Action Type you will use.
  * Used to tell us that the data you're sending us is new and we need to save it in the database.
  * Available for use on all Segments except for Header and Footer (Those don't have an Action Type).
* D - Delete
  * The next most common Action type used.
  * Used to tell us that we need to delete an Incident from the Database.
  * Is only used with Segment 10. Do delete an Incident you just send us the Segment 10 of the Incident, but change the I to a D in the third Character.
* W - Time Window Submission *(Legacy)*
  * Used to submit data to the FBI for Incidents that occurred before the Agency's Base Date
  * Really uncommon to be used.
* A - Add Arrest *(Legacy)*
  * You can use this to add an Arrest to an already reported Incident.
  * We would recommend just passing us a Delete and then resubmitting the whole Incident as an Insert, though. It's less code for everyone to manage.
* M - Arrest Modification *(Legacy)*
  * This can be used to change details about an Arrestee that's already been submitted to LIBRS.
  * Again, we recommend not using this in favor of deleting the Incident and re-inserting it.

**Data Characteristics:** 1 Character Alpha. Used on every segment in the Flat File Except for the Header and Footer Segments.

**Requirements:**

|                  Requirement                  | Requirement Description  |   Error Number   | Error Message           |

|      A      | **Add Arrest** `<br>`Action Type "A" submissions are used to add an arrest to an incident that has previously been reported with an Action Type of "I". Action Type "A" can only be used if incident has already been submitted and there are no changes in other segments of the incident, that is, the agency is simply adding an arrest segment to the already submitted incident                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|      M      | **Modify** `<br>`Action Type "M" segments are used for Time-Window Submission correction for an Exceptional Clearance, Recovered Property or Arrests). It can alsobe used to modify exceptional clearance indicator and/or exceptional clearance date when incident has already been submitted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|      D      | **Delete Action** `<br>`Type "D" segments are used to delete previously submitted incidents. It is often used when updates or changes are reported to a previously submitted incident. An Action Type "D" segment will delete all existing incident data, allowing the reporting agency to re-submit the incident containing the updated information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|      W      | **Time-Window Submission** `<br>`Action Type "W" is used only when reporting an incident that occurred prior to the reporting agency's "base date" as defined in the Guidelines. An agency's base date is usually the date when the agency first started reporting incident-based data to LIBRS/NIBRS. The Time-Window Submission can report one of the following:`<br>`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Exceptional Clearance`<br>`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Exceptional Clearance Date`<br>`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Recovered Property`<br>`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - An Arrest |

## Clearance Indicator (C6)

---

*For Time Window Submissions, ONLY*

**Description:** Clearance Indication is a Y/N Value that's used exclusively in Time Window Submissions to state whether or not the Incident has been cleared by an Arrest or not.

**Data Characteristics:** 1 Character Alpha.

**Requirements:**

|                  Requirement                  | Requirement Description  |   Error Number   | Error Message           |

---

### Details:

* Clearance Indicator (C6) is used in the Arrestee Segment (60) to indicate whether this arrest produced a clearance, or is an additional arrest on a previously cleared incident that is outside the agency's base date.

---

**Allowed Entries for Data Element C6:**

  ||Clearance Indicator |
  ||--------------------- |
  |Y                     |Yes - Submit "Y", if this is the first Arrestee Segment (60) submitted for an Incident. By submitting a "Y", the Arrest clears an Incident that happened prior to the date the agency began submitting Incident-Based Data to the LIBRS/NIBRS system (that is, a Time-Window case that is not on the LIBRS/NIBRS database).
  |N                     |No - Submit 'N', if a previous Arrest Segment (60) was already submitted for an Incident. (That is, the case has already been cleared for an Incident that occurred since the agency's base data, and is in the LIBRS/NIBRS database).

---

<br>

## Number of Segments Transferred (C7)

---

**Description:** Number of Segments Transferred is quite literally the number of lines that are present in a LIBRS Flat File, including the Header and the Footer Segments. Effectively it is just the line number of the Footer Segment.

**Data Characteristics:** 6 Character Numeric, Front-Padded with zeros (EG: 525 should be 000525).. Only used in Footer Segment (Segment 99)

**Requirements:**

|                  Requirement                  | Requirement Description  |   Error Number   | Error Message           |
| :--------------------------------------------: | ------------------------ | :--------------: | ----------------------- |
| {% assign error = site.data.error["20001"] -%} |                          |                  |                         |
|                       1                       | {{error.seq_desc["c7"]}} | {{error.err_no}} | {{ error.err_message }} |
| {% assign error = site.data.error["20031"] -%} |                          |                  |                         |
|                       3                       | {{error.seq_desc["c7"]}} | {{error.err_no}} | {{ error.err_message }} |

---

### Details:

---

**Allowed Entries:** Any integer greater than or equal to 000003.

---

<br>

<div class="newpage"></div>

## End of Segment Marker (C8)

---

**Description:** The End of Segment Marker us used to tell LIBRS where the data in a line ends, and if anything else is in the line to ignore it. It is an older data element that was brought forward for backwards compatibilty, however it is important that it is placed in the correct location and is the correct characters ('ZZ').

**Data Characteristics:** 2 Character Alpha. Only in every Segment.

**Requirements:**

|                  Requirement                  | Requirement Description  |   Error Number   | Error Message           |
| :--------------------------------------------: | ------------------------ | :--------------: | ----------------------- |
| {% assign error = site.data.error["20001"] -%} |                          |                  |                         |
|                       1                       | {{error.seq_desc["c8"]}} | {{error.err_no}} | {{ error.err_message }} |
| {% assign error = site.data.error["20029"] -%} |                          |                  |                         |

---

### Details:

This field is used to provide LIBRS with a way to determine where an end of record occurs. In the event of an error in record length this will allow the LIBRS system to find the start of the next record and possibly recover from the error. The "End of Segment" marker is the same for all segments, two capitol Z's.

---

**Allowed Entries:** "ZZ" only.

---

<br>

## Padding (C9)

---

**Description:** Padding is used to fill out unused area in a LIBRS Flat File to keep consistent formatting across each Segment.

**Data Characteristics**: Character Alpha/Numeric. Used in every Segment.

**Requirements:**

| Requirement | Requirement Description                                                                                                                                      |
| :---------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      1      | Must be Blank (G) if fixed length records are submitted. MUST be one newline character (ASCII 13; CR, LF, or CRLF) if variable length records are submitted. |
|      2      | If Fixed-Length records are used, add padding from the End of Segment Marker (C8) to exactly column 150.                                                     |
|      3      | Segment 00 MUST have both Padding to column 150 and a new line charachter (ASCII 13; CR, LF, or CRLF)                                                        |

---

### Details:

* This field is used to pad unused fields for systems that are unable to write variable length records. This padding will lengthen all segments to 150 characters. Previously there may have been some confusion about whether to use a New Line Character after the Segment End Marker - this is incorrect. Please Pad all Segments to 150 Characters long.

---

**Allowed Entries:** Blank spaces or the newline character (ASCII 13).

---

## Software ID (C10)

---

**Description:** Software ID is used to tell LIBRS the RMS Software that was used to generate the LIBRS Flat File. This is useful because if we find an error that's being caused by something invalid in the Flat File it allows us to track down the Vendor/Agencies that are affected and help get the issue resolved.

**Data Characteristics**: 5 Characters Alpha/Numeric. Only used in Header Segment (Segment 00)

**Requirements:**

| Requirement | Requirement Description                                                        |

|      1      | Contains Identification of software used to generate the LIBRS data submission |

---

<br>

## Software Version (C11)

---

**Description:** Software Version is used to tell LIBRS the Version RMS Software that was used to generate the LIBRS Flat File. This is useful because if we find an error that's being caused by something invalid in the Flat File it allows us to track down the Vendor/Agencies that are affected and help get the issue resolved.

**Data Characteristics**: 10 Characters Alpha/Numeric. Only used in Header Segment (Segment 00)

**Requirements:**

| Requirement | Requirement Description                                                 |
